# Lutris
Lutris is probably the best thing to happen to Linux gaming since Steam. That's no small assertion, but it's true. Lutris is awesome. It makes installing and managing games on Linux a whole lot easier than ever before, and it works with Wine.   In fact, the Lutris developers are so dedicated to Wine support, they actually took over maintanership of Wine Staging. Lutris does Wine really well. Most popular games have a one click installer that allows you to install a game through Wine just as easily as you would a native game. Not only that, the installers use the most optimal settings avaialable, so there's no need to fiddle with Winetricks or any of the usual Wine configuration utilities.   Lutris isn't available through the default Ubuntu repositories just yet, but the developers do package it for Ubuntu and maintain a repository that makes having the latest version of Lutris a breeze.
